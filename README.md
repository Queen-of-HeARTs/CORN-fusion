# CORN-fusion

Hey my name is JESSIE. I go just started colorado Tech.
I am a single mom hopeless romantic that knows history repeats itself.
So why don't we all do our part and take initiative to save our world by saving lose 
May wander and not necessarily fully lost.
I'm fresh out of the box coding, decade in diapers might as 
Call it. 90s baby. Far out of this world from the land before time stuff.
So stick a fork in me I'm done walking this road alone. 
We can do it. Cause we should and we can so we will.
Together.
